Question

The current selected programming language is CPP. We emphasize the submission of a fully
working code over partially correct but efficient code. Once submitted, you cannot review this
problem again. You can use cout to debug your code. The cout may not work in case of
syntax/runtime error. The version of GCC being used is 5.5.0.

A software company receives a request to update an application as per the latest requirements.
The application contains data for N years identified as 0 to N-1. As per the latest requirements,
the analyst working on the update must analyse the data which is in strictly ascending order.
This means that no two numbers can be the same in the data. The application must remove the
data of groups of consecutive years such that the data of remaining years will be in strictly
ascending order. Only one group can be removed. The analyst must find the number of groups
that could be removed to fulfil the received requirement.

Write an algorithm to find the number of groups that could be removed to fulfil the received
requirement.

Input

The first line of the input consists of an integer – yearData_Size, representing the number of
years for which data is displayed in the application (N).
The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the displayed data of years.

Output

Print an integer representing the number of groups that could be removed to fulfil the received
requirement.
